### Business Problem
Old Time Pottery doesn't have many state-of-the-art technologies compared to many other name-brand retail companies, especially when it comes to inventory and allocation planning. For the most part, the primary tools that are used for this department are Excel spreadsheets and domain knowledge, two fairly volatile metrics. Excel has limitations when it comes to working with the hundreds of thousands of active SKUs within the company, and any employee could leave the company as soon as they win the lottery. Therefore, implementing a machine learning solution that utilizes previous sales information to predict the number of units that need to be sent to a specific store by SKU would be ideal as both a time and cost saver.

### Models Used
Two models, one simpler and one more complex, were used and compared against each other in order to determine which was the best fit for this problem;
- Multiple Linear Regression:
    - With this problem having mulitple predictors, this model seemed like the best general fit as a simple, baseline metric
- XGBoost:
    - With this model being an industry standard, it seemed like the best fit as a more complex model

### Model Performance
AHHHHHHHHHHH (i'm lazy so this will be finished later)


how do i wanna split this up

1. ~~talk about the nature of my problem, why im doing it in the first place and what i hope to achieve~~
2. bring up the two models i used i guess??? mlr and xgb
3. discuss how the mlr model performed (rmse and r2) and how xgb performed (rmse r2)
4. explain the cons for both cause they both have some
5. i guesss finally which one i would choose to apply within the business
